rem
rem Visual Studio 2017, as happens with earlier versions, forces its high contrast theme if Windows is under a high contrast theme as well.
rem Microsoft seems not to be interested in fixing it so people have to use certain registry hacks to use Visual Studio's dark theme.
rem Before the 2017 release, Visual Studio settings were right in the registry and you could do the hack by hand more or less easily.
rem
rem A first problem with that is that under some circumstances (for instance, after updates) the theme setting switches back to high contrast
rem and you have to re-apply the hack. Another problem is that from the 2017 release the registry settings have been moved to a hive file
rem so you have first to load it into the global registry, do the hack and unload it again.
rem
rem The purpose of this program is to apply the hack for Visual Studio 2017 automatically. It makes a backup of the key containing
rem the high contrast theme to a new key with '.backup' appended to its name and copies the dark theme key recursively over that of the high contrast one.
rem It first checks if the backup is already present to avoid overwriting it with the already-tampered data.
rem
rem This program applies the hack on every installation of Visual Studio 2017 present in the system.
